# Neuro-FLOPER
A program that allows you to translate neural networks created with Keras to fuzzy logic programs, in order to tune these networks from a given dataset. I created this tool during the development of my Final Year Project, and it wants to solve structural deficiencies created during the training process of a multilayer perceptron. This project has been developed with DEC-Tau research team.
## Prerequisites
In order to execute Neuro-FLOPER in your machine, you must have installed:
* Python 2.7
* Keras 2.1.4
* Tensorflow 1.3.0
* SWI-Prolog 6.0.2 for x86_64-linux
