# Neuro-FLOPER
A program that allows you to translate neural networks created with Keras to fuzzy logic programs, in order to tune these networks from a given dataset. I created this tool during the development of my Final Year Project, and it wants to solve structural deficiencies created during the training process of a multilayer perceptron. This project has been developed with DEC-Tau research team.
## Prerequisites

In order to execute Neuro-FLOPER in your machine, you must have installed:
* Python 2.7
* Keras 2.1.4
* Tensorflow 1.3.0
* SWI-Prolog 6.0.2 for x86_64-linux
* PyQt4

## DOCUMENTATION

The full document of this project appears also in this repository. It corresponds to the final memory for the FYP <a href="https://github.com/Xachap/Neuro-FLOPER/blob/master/Developing%20Fuzzy%20Neural%20Networks%20With%20The%20FLOPER%20Environment.pdf">"Developing Fuzzy Neural Networks With The FLOPER Environment"</a>.
